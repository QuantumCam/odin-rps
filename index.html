    <!--
    <p>The goal here is simple and one that many trainers before you have faced: 
        Choose the best pokemon to go against your rival.
        Each pokemon you see has their own strength or weakness against one or the other. 
        Fire type is strong against grass type but weak against water type. 
        Water type is strong against fire type but weak against grass type. And grass is strong against water type but weak against fire type. 
    </p>
    <p>Choose wisely, for whomever choses the stronger pokemon stands a greater chance at collecting all gym badges and competing in the Elite Four Championship Tournament!</p>-->
